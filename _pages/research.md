Single-atom optical tweezer arrays have served as a platform for cutting-edge research in quantum computers, quantum simulators, quantum metrology, and quantum optics. Using strontium, an alkaline-earth element with a rich energy structure, demonstrations of the most accurate clock measurements and highest fidelity quantum computing gate operations have been demonstrated.

In the [Will Lab](https://www.will-lab.com/), our strontium tweezer experiment looks to improve the platform in a few key areas:
1. Design and implementation of a compact, dispenser-based 2D MOT for strontium that provides a high atomic flux.
2. The development and implementation of holographic metasurfaces for the creation of high quality optical tweezer arrays with arbitrary geometries in 1D, 2D, and 3D.
3. Study super- and subradiance in free space, single atom arrays using strontium's unique level structure.
