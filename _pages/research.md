Test

Arrays of individual neutral atoms in optical tweezers have been demonstrated as an excellent platform to study fundamental research as well as technologies involving quantum simulators, memories, atomic clocks, and metrology. As an alkaline-earth element, strontium has a rich energy structure that allows for trappable Rydberg states as well as access to a metastable, clock state.

As part of this platform, I developed a new dispensers based strontium source that is compact, cheap, and efficient.

Our experiment also implements holographic metasurfaces for the creation of high quality optical tweezer arrays with arbitrary geometries in 1D, 2D, and 3D.

Here is an early summary of our experiment from DAMOP 2021.
