## Coding Club
With the help of [Ana Asenjo-Garcia](https://anaasenjogarcia.com/index.php/outreach/) and other graduate students at Columbia, we started a coding club/physics outreach program at Democracy Prep Harlem High School. We meet weekly during the school year working through both Snap and python curricula. You can find our website [here](https://sites.google.com/view/dphhs-coding-club/home).

## Columbia University Spectra
[Spectra](https://spectra.physics.columbia.edu) is a society for diversity and inclusion in physics. I help host a weekly problem solving session every Wednesday where students from all levels can work together in an inclusive environment.

## STEMteachersNYC
[Simplifying Superposition](https://stemteachersnyc.org/simplifying-superposition-quantum-principles/) was a workshop I developed with the help of STEMteacheryNYC. This program taught the basics of quantum mechanics, in particular superposition, to high school teachers across the country. This was done using specially developed tools accessible to the classroom.
