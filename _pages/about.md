    title: "Novel strontium dispensers with shields."

I am a Physics PhD Student in the Will Lab at Columbia University building a programmable strontium tweezer array. This platform has applications in quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum optics. In addition to my research, I am interested in improving STEM teaching at all education levels.
